title: Course Introduction
---

### Welcome

* Introduce yourself
* Depending on class size have students introduce themselves

### Course goals

* Data and how to work with it
* Data entry -> Data storage -> Data manipulation -> Data visualization
* Not statistics

### Teaching methods

* Flipped classroom
    * You don't learn how ride a bike just by listening to someone talk about it
      and the same is true for computing
* Reading or videos before class
* I do, we do, you do
    * I will demo an idea using live coding
	* We will work on an associated exercise together in class
	* You will work on additional exercises on your own (both in & out of class)
* Peer instruction
    * Interact with each other during the we do and you do parts
	* You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from me
	* Introduce yourself to one of your neighbors you don't know

### Course structure

* Weekly assignments
    * Practice is really important for learning skills like this
    * Work on exercises in class
	* Will require additional programming time after class
	* Due end of the day on Tuesday via Blackboard
	* 75% of grade

* Topic Lectures
    * Designed to practice instruction techniques
    * Ideally related to a tool you will use in your research
    * Should include worked examples and assignment (I do, we do, you do)
    * 25% of grade (grading rubric will be provided ahead of time during class)
