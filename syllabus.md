*Note: my schedule gets very busy during the semester so
please try to schedule appointments in advance. In general it
will be very difficult to set up appointments less than 24 hours in advance.*

We will also use Blackboard to submit assignments and for other course announcements and communications.


### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class.


### Course Description

Computers are increasingly essential to the study of all aspects of
biology. Data management skills are needed for entering data without errors,
storing it in a usable way, and extracting key aspects of the data for
analysis. Basic programming is required for everything from accessing and
managing data, to statistical analysis, to modeling. This course will provide an
introduction to data management, manipulation, and analysis, with an emphasis on
biological problems. Class will typically consist of short introductions or
question & answer sessions, followed by hands on computing exercises. The course
will be taught using R and SQLite, but the concepts learned will easily apply to
all programming languages and database management systems. No background in
programming or databases is required.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology.


### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn all of the fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting biological research. By the end of
the course you will be able to use these tools to import data into R, perform
analysis on that data, and export the results to graphs, text files, and
databases. By learning how to get the computer to do your work for you, you will
be able to do more science faster.


### Course Goals and Objectives

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Create well structured databases
* Extract information from databases
* Write simple computer programs in R
* Automate data analysis
* Apply these tools to address biological questions
* Apply general data management and analysis concepts to other programming
  languages and database management systems


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
learning to program and work with data requires actively working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I think they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this great
[info-graphic](https://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom-2/).


### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes will
involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies


### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Tuesday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time. This allows you to be finished with one week's material before starting the next week's material. Submit materials through our Blackboard course site.


### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops (see [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup)
for installation instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


## VCU Policies

Students should visit [http://go.vcu.edu/syllabus](http://go.vcu.edu/syllabus) and review all syllabus statement information. The full university syllabus statement includes information on safety, registration, the VCU Honor Code, student conduct, withdrawal and more.

**Most importantly, if you are struggling for any reason please come talk to me
and I will do my best to help.**


## Grading Policies

Grading for this course is based on 10 equally weighted assignments (75%), and 1 course project (25%).

One problem
from each assignment (selected at the instructors discretion after the
assignments have been submitted) will receive a thorough code review and a
detailed grade. Other problems will be graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
    answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
    50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

The course project may focus on a core topic listed in the syllabus or another topic of interest. More details will be provided in class.

### Grading scale

- **A 90-100**
- **B 80-89**
- **C 70-79**
- **D 60-69**
- **F <60**


## Course Schedule

The details course schedule is available on the course website at:

**Disclaimer:** This syllabus represents my current plans and objectives. As we
go through the semester, those plans may need to change to enhance the class
learning opportunity. Such changes will be communicated clearly both on the
website and in class.
