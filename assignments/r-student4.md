Git and GitHub Assignment

Part 1: Practice with GitHub:

  Create a new repository on your GitHub account space. At a minimum, it needs to include a title, description, README file, and at least one other file (e.g. .R code file). As an extra challenge, you can create a .gitignore file to exclude file types you do not want included in updates to your repository over time.

  For help, see the “hello-world” assignment from class: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Part 2: Practice with Command Line Git:

  Recall the “hello-world” repository you made in class. Using the Git BASH/Mac Terminal application you used earlier, as well as the commands discussed in ProGit Chapter 2, do the following:

  --clone your “hello-world” repository to a local drive (e.g. Desktop)

  --open your README file (may need to select a text reader application to open if computer does not default to using one, e.g. Notepad on Windows)

  --add one line of text to the bottom saying “Homework is Fun”

  --commit the change you made by using “git add” and “git commit” functions (see ProGit Ch. 2 or notes from class if confused)

Submit via Blackboard:

  A .txt file with your copied and pasted commands for Part 2 requirements.  In the comments box on the submission page, include the URL for your new repository to satisfy Part 1 requirements.
