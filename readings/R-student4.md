* Git and GitHub (Lisa and Connie):

  * [Introduction to Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

    Please read Chapter 1 (sections 1.1-1.8) before class on November 28th. We will be installing Git on your laptop in class but also hope to touch on some topics in Chapter 2 and Chapter 6 as well. Feel free to glance over the first couple pages of Chapter 2 and
    6 so the vocabulary used in class sounds familiar.

    Disclaimer: There is a lot to Git and GitHub that canâ€™t possibly be covered within one class. Good news though- you have the link above to help you tap into the full potential of Git and
    GitHub after our introductory lesson!

* Publication Ready Graphs (Shea):

  * [Graphing Tips for ggplot2 (and life)](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/lab03.html)
  * [ggplot2.customize](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-customize-how-to-personalize-easily-ggplot2-graphs-in-r-statistical-software)
  * [Plotting in R*](http://marianattestad.com/blog) * Specifically "Lesson 5: Tweaking everything in a plot"
