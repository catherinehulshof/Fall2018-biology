#### Learning Objectives for Independent Projects

> Following this assignment students should be able to:
>
> - identify relevant reference materials related to particular tasks
> - design an advanced set of tasks to demonstrate the selected concept

Submit your proposal (1 page max) that describes:

1. what data you are planning on working with
2. what packages or tools you are thinking about using
3. what task(s) you aim to achieve
4. any questions you have about how to best proceed

Projects will ultimately include a few key reference materials, a well-commented and stylized R script, figures produced by your script, and any other relevant documentation or files.
