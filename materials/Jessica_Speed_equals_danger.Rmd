## Better to be safe than sorry

##Here is a table reminding us what not to do while driving 

Driving DO's  | Driving Don'ts 
------------- | -------------
Safety Belt   | Texting
Checking Mirrors  | Speeding 


```{r cars, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
summary(cars)
```

## Increasing speed will increase stopping distance!!

Let's look at some numbers that help prove it!

```{r echo=FALSE}
lmcars <- lm(speed~dist, data = cars)
summary(lmcars)
```

*What does this mean graphically?*


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist))
