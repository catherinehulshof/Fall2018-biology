title: Course Introduction
---

### Welcome

* Introduce yourself
* Depending on class size have students introduce themselves

### Course goals

* Data and how to work with it
* Data entry -> Data storage -> Data manipulation -> Data visualization
* Not statistics or machine learning

### Expected background

* Assumes no background in R or any of the other things we'll learn
* If you're already good at R it's worth spending some time with the website
  (which we're about to look at) to see if this a good fit for you
* Information on more advanced options


### Teaching methods (normal year)

* Flipped classroom
    * You don't learn how ride a bike just by listening to someone talk about it
      and the same is true for computing
    * So we use a fair bit of class time for working on exercises, asking questions, and getting help
* Reading or videos before class
* I do, we do, you do
    * I will demo an idea using live coding
	* We will work on an associated exercise together in class
	* You will work on additional exercises on your own (both in & out of class)
* Peer instruction
    * Interact with each other during the we do and you do parts
	* You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from me
    * If you already know some of the material and are getting ahead, see if
      there's someone you can help
	* Introduce yourself to one of your neighbors you don't know


* Weekly assignments
    * Practice is really important for learning skills like this
    * Work on exercises in class
	* Will require additional programming time after class
	* Due end of the day on Monday via Canvas

### Course structure

> Open website

* Lessons integrated with weekly assignments
* Practice is really important for learning skills like this
* Work through video lessons and exercises before class
* Class sessions will have both full class Q&A w/live codeing and 1:1 help
* All exercises are part of the assignments.
* Work on them until you get stuck and then ask for help, don't struggle for hours on online help sites
* Assignments for the first 12 weeks of class and then optional ungraded content though the end of the semester
* Assignments due end of the day on Monday, but with an automatic 48 hour extension if you need it

### Website

*Walk through the website showing the following items*

* Schedule
    * Walk through schedule (quickly)
* Readings
    * Read before relevant class
    * No need to do any challenges or exercises in readings
* Lessons
    * Alternating short videos (to introduce idea) and exercise (to start using that idea)
    * Whether you are treating the class as synchronous or asynchronous alternating between video and exercise will be most effective for most of you
* Lectures
    * Lectures notes used in class
	* Not expected to read in advance; may be useful for review
	* May not match lecture precisely
* Assignments
    * Answers provided

### Syllabus

* Grading
    * Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
    * Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect answer: 90%
    * Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept: 50%
    * No answer or answer lacking basic understanding of core concept: 0%
* Give it a read and let me know if you have any questions

### Office Hours

* TBD

### Canvas

* Show Canvas
* Will publish modules as soon as the material is ready to be worked on
* First thing Monday at the latest, but hopefully much earlier
* Handle assignment submission, grading, and announcements through Canvas

### Inclusive and Accessible Course

* Learning computing is hard
* Learning computing in a classroom that doesn't provide a supportive environment is awful
* It's really important to me that this course provide a positive, inclusive, accessible, learning environment for everyone
* If that is not the experience you are having for any reason, just let me know and I'll actively work to correct it.


### First day demo

* With the little time we have left I just want to do a quick demo of some of
  the things you'll be able to do by the time we're half way through the class
